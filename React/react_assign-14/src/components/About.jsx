              <div className="about-description">
                Edstem was founded by K K Ashraf and Jerrish Varghese in 2012
                primarily for developing products in education domain. Both of
                them were quite experienced in their respective domains which
                they wanted to utilize for new product development for schools.
                There were 3 developers initially who were working from home for
                a school management product and it got launched in one pilot
                school by 2013 September. The initial experience with schools in
                Middle East, research and study, and that hub of expertise
                transformed into a small consulting group and led us to create
                some of our first school management softwares for
              </div>
              <div className="about-description">
                Later, we shifted our focus to both product as well as custom
                software development. In 2015 the team size crossed 10 members
                and we were able to launch new products in to the market for
                schools. The first custom software development opportunity we
                received was from Dubai SME, to work with Dubai Entrepreneurship
                Academy for the custom software development of their new portal.
                The project had its own challenge including Arabic language
                support which was something new to the development team. It was
                widely appreciated and gave us the confidence to do more
                software development projects, across the globe.

              <div className="about-description">
                With technology more important than ever, in 2018 we setup a new
                Development Center with an ever growing team size of more than
                50 members currently working on new trending technologies in all
                aspects of software development. All our core products are
                revamped, and our clientele has expanded from Middle East over
                to Europe and US – some of them have been our technology partner
                for years. We know it’s just the beginning, and as we believe –
                Sky is our limit, and technology is limitless!
